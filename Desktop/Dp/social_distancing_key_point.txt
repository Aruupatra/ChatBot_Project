What does cv2 DNN blobFromImage?
Image result for cv2.dnn.blobfromimage
The cv2. dnn. blobFromImage function returns a 
blob which is our input image after mean
subtraction, normalizing, and channel swapping



Dnn:
Deep neural networks (DNN) can be defined
as ANNs with additional depth, that is, an increased number 
of hidden layers between the input and the output layers.

MobileNet-v2:
It is a convolutional neural network that
 is 53 layers deep. You can load a pretrained version
 of the network trained on more than a million images from 
the ImageNet database [1]. The pretrained network can classify
 images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil,
 and many animals. As a result, the network has learned rich feature
 representations for a wide range of images.
 The network has an image input size of 224-by-224.


MobilenetSSD:

MobilenetSSD is an object detection model that computes the bounding box and category of an object 
from an input image. This Single Shot Detector (SSD) object detection model
 uses Mobilenet as backbone and can achieve fast object detection optimized for mobile devices.


What's the difference between MobileNet and MobileNet SSD?

As far as I know, mobilenet is a neural network that is used for classification and recognition whereas 
the SSD is a framework that is used to realize the multibox detector. Only the combination of
 both can do object detection.
 Thus, mobilenet can be interchanged with resnet, inception and so on


blobfromimage
-------------
Creates 4-dimensional blob from image. Optionally resizes and crops image from center,
 subtract mean values, scales values by scalefactor, swap Blue and Red channels.
What is a Framework:
 it provides the support and basic ‘guide’ of the structure being built. 
-Have functions which are reusable


caffe
------
Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind
